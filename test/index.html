            <h2>Article Introduction</h2>
            <p>Our world is changing; for the elderly, semiconductors, the world wide web, mobile phones etc., were new inventions in their lifetime[cite: 72]. These brought severe changes, and technology developed rapidly[cite: 73]. Those left behind struggle to catch up and may resist learning new skills[cite: 74], widening the gap between them and the tech-savvy[cite: 75]. Post-pandemic, digitalization of services has increased[cite: 76], further merging physical and digital worlds. Without intervention, the elderly risk marginalization[cite: 77].</p>

            <h2>Article Summary</h2>
            <p>The digital divide refers to the gap older adults face in accessing information and communication technology (ICT)[cite: 79], leading to potential exclusion from digital society[cite: 80], a serious social issue[cite: 81]. Modern trends show increasing reliance on digital services for government functions, payments, and commerce[cite: 82, 83], often reducing in-person options[cite: 84, 85, 86, 87]. This shift disadvantages those lacking digital literacy or access, particularly the elderly[cite: 88, 89], and increases vulnerability to cybercrime[cite: 90]. Elderly individuals face challenges with complex applications[cite: 91, 92], device accessibility issues (eyesight, hearing)[cite: 93], and psychological barriers like feeling ICT is for the 'digital natives' [cite: 94] or lacking confidence[cite: 96, 99]. However, promoting ICT use among seniors offers benefits: it's becoming a vital life skill[cite: 100], enables self-sufficiency (e.g., online health services)[cite: 101], potentially reducing costs for support services[cite: 102, 103], and helps maintain social connections, easing loneliness[cite: 104, 105, 106]. Recommendations include developing elderly-friendly technology[cite: 108, 109, 110], conducting cross-sector research[cite: 111, 112, 113], providing effective ICT tutorials focusing on self-learning[cite: 114, 115, 116], training volunteers[cite: 117, 118], and encouraging family support[cite: 119, 120, 121, 122]. Addressing this digital divide is crucial for societal inclusion[cite: 107, 124, 125].</p>

            <div id="report-note-content">
                <p><strong>Text 1: Digital Marginalization of Older Adults</strong><br>
                Stance: Digital marginalization significantly affects older adults, exacerbating their exclusion from a digitally dominated society[cite: 1].<br>
                Trends and Phenomena: Increased reliance on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) post-COVID-19[cite: 2]. Deepening digital divide between older and younger generations, with only 27.7% of seniors using online media compared to 83.0% of younger individuals[cite: 3].<br>
                Issues: Barriers such as economic constraints and inadequate access to technology[cite: 4]. Psychological factors, including anxiety and lack of confidence in using digital devices[cite: 5].<br>
                Recommendations: Acknowledge the urgent need for initiatives to bridge the digital divide for older adults[cite: 6].<br>
                Related Sentences: "Digitally marginalized individuals or groups are deprived of total participation in the life of a digital society." [cite: 7] "The rich are often equipped with state-of-the-art devices and high-speed internet connections, whereas the less privileged often face very limited access." [cite: 8]</p>

                <p><strong>Text 2: Impact of Regular Internet Use on Seniors’ Wellness</strong><br>
                Stance: Regular internet use is essential for improving the wellness of older adults[cite: 9].<br>
                Trends and Phenomena: Digital skills are becoming necessary life skills for older adults[cite: 10]. Engagement in online activities correlates with reduced loneliness and improved mental well-being[cite: 11].<br>
                Issues: A significant portion of seniors (only 27%) use social networking sites regularly, leading to vulnerability to loneliness and depression[cite: 12].<br>
                Recommendations: Promote digital inclusion to alleviate social isolation and enhance the quality of life for seniors[cite: 13].<br>
                Related Sentences: "Digitally marginalized seniors...were found more vulnerable to loneliness and depression." [cite: 14] "Digital inclusion potentially alleviates social isolation and improves the mental well-being of older adults." [cite: 15]</p>

                <p><strong>Text 3: Research Field of Digital Marginalization of Older Adults</strong><br>
                Stance: There is an increasing academic focus on the digital marginalization of older adults due to rising digital disparities[cite: 16].<br>
                Trends and Phenomena: A surge in publications regarding digital inclusion and marginalization since 2019, particularly post-pandemic[cite: 17].<br>
                Issues: Older adults face significant challenges in digital competence, impacting their participation in society[cite: 18].<br>
                Recommendations: More research and collaboration are needed to understand the needs of older adults in a digital context[cite: 19].<br>
                Related Sentences: "The number of publications on the digital divide and digital marginalization of older adults has significantly increased after 2019." [cite: 20] "This growing recognition has led to focused efforts to bridge the digital divide for older adults." [cite: 21]</p>

                <p><strong>Text 4: Challenges of Launching Elderly Digital Education</strong><br>
                Stance: Promoting digital education for older adults is crucial but faces several challenges[cite: 22].<br>
                Trends and Phenomena: Governments are intensifying efforts to improve digital inclusion as a national strategy[cite: 23].<br>
                Issues: Lack of technical support and professional training for young volunteers teaching older adults[cite: 24]. Many older adults remain dependent on traditional methods due to limited digital skills[cite: 25].<br>
                Recommendations: Provide better training for volunteers and develop more accessible digital education programs for older adults[cite: 26].<br>
                Related Sentences: "There is a lack of technical support and professional training for those young volunteers." [cite: 27] "Promoting digital inclusion has become every country’s national development strategy in the twenty-first century." [cite: 28]</p>

                 <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p><strong>T5 The Digital Divide Among Low-Income Homebound Older Adults:</strong><br>
                    Stances: The study emphasizes the significant digital divide affecting low-income homebound older adults, particularly those aged 60 and older[cite: 29]. These individuals are particularly vulnerable and often lack access to the Internet and digital resources[cite: 30]. Internet technology is portrayed as essential for managing health, maintaining social connections, and improving quality of life for homebound older adults[cite: 31].<br>
                    Trends: Low Internet Use: Only 34% of those under 60 and 17% of those 60 and older were current Internet users[cite: 32], a substantial gap[cite: 33]. Discontinued Use: A considerable number reported discontinuing Internet use (35% under-60, 16% 60+) primarily due to cost and disabilities[cite: 34]. Demographics of Non-Users: Never users are more likely to be black or Hispanic, have lower incomes, and experience more chronic medical conditions[cite: 35].<br>
                    Phenomena: eHealth Literacy: Low eHealth literacy among older adults is critical for navigating health information online [cite: 36] and is associated with poorer health outcomes[cite: 37]. Attitudes Toward Technology: Mixed attitudes, with many expressing anxiety and lack of confidence[cite: 38].<br>
                    Issues: Barriers include lack of financial resources, physical disabilities, and absence of training[cite: 39]. Low-income homebound older adults face significant health challenges exacerbated by social isolation and lack of access to online health resources[cite: 40].<br>
                    Recommendations: Implement training programs for eHealth literacy[cite: 41]. Increase access to affordable computers and Internet services[cite: 42]. Promote telehealth services[cite: 43]. Engage community organizations for support[cite: 44].<br>
                    Related Sentences: "This study is the first to describe in detail low-income disabled and homebound adults’ and older adults’ Internet use." [cite: 45] "Internet technology can provide a diverse array of online resources for homebound older adults..." [cite: 46] "...reasons for not using computer/Internet technology: the cost... functional impairments..." [cite: 47] "Given vulnerable... adults’ substantial health and mental needs, examining their ability to search for... health information... may be particularly useful." [cite: 47] "Recommendations to reduce the digital divide... are provided." [cite: 48]</p>
                     <p><strong>T6 Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, Digital Learners</strong><br>
                     Stances: The terms "digital natives" and "digital immigrants" lack empirical support and clear definitions[cite: 49]. Students’ digital competence may be lower than expected despite frequent technology use[cite: 50]. Related: "Many authors... found a more unifying concept... 'Digital Learner.'"[cite: 49], "Students... use computers... for rapid communication... but may lack advanced skills." [cite: 51]<br>
                     Trends and Phenomena: Generational Labels: Concept questioned, call for nuanced understanding[cite: 52]. Related: "need to move beyond the superficial dichotomy..." [cite: 53] Use of Technology: Not strictly age-related; context and individual differences matter[cite: 54]. Related: "Generation or age groupings are... used to explain... use of communication technologies..." [cite: 55]<br>
                     Issues: Lack of Empirical Evidence: Claims often anecdotal[cite: 56]. Related: "key claims are based on popular... literature... informed by anecdotal information." [cite: 57] Misconceptions about Digital Skills: Assumption of advanced skills in 'natives' is misleading[cite: 58]. Related: "Being a member of the 'Net Generation' does not translate to knowing how to use... advanced... tools." [cite: 59]<br>
                     Recommendations: Focus on Individual Variables: Consider factors beyond age in curriculum design[cite: 60]. Related: "necessary... look at other individual variables besides age." [cite: 61] Adapt to Context: Decisions context-specific, not based on stereotypes[cite: 62]. Related: "rather than a focus on generation, context is more important..." [cite: 63] Embrace a Unifying Concept: Adopt "Digital Learners"[cite: 64]. Related: "...need a unifying term... without bias toward age or generation." [cite: 65] Many elderly think ICT is for younger 'digital natives'[cite: 66, 69]. Most elderly can learn with the right attitude[cite: 67, 70]. This thinking can cause avoidance[cite: 68, 71]. Removing the 'digital immigrant' label is a challenge[cite: 68, 71].</p>
