        <h1>Alleviating digital marginalization by ICT and more care from society</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our world is changing, for the elderly, semiconductors, world wide web, mobile phones etc. were some new things invented in their lifetime[cite: 72]. All of them have brought severe changes in people’s lives and the birth of new industries and hence the technology developed rapidly later[cite: 73]. Therefore, once they have been left behind during the development of these technologies, they can hardly catch up with the trend and eventually resist learning new skills[cite: 74]. However, these will broaden the gap between them and those familiar with these skills[cite: 75]. Especially now, post-pandemic, more and more services have been digitalized[cite: 76]. The physical world has further merged with digital world. If this issue is not eased, the elderly may finally be marginalized[cite: 77].</p>

        <h2>Why should we alleviate the digital divide of the elderly?</h2>
        <p>The phenomenon that people (older adults) have a gap in accessing information and communication technology (ICT) is also known as digital divide[cite: 79]. “Digitally marginalized individuals or groups are deprived of total participation in the life of a digital society”[cite: 80]. This is a serious social issue that has various consequences[cite: 81].</p>

        <h3>Modern ICT trend</h3>
        <p>The convergence of the physical and digital worlds accelerates as more government services (e.g. pending medical services, application of social welfare), payment options (e.g. FPS, Alipay), and commercial services offerings online services[cite: 82]. This trend shows that these services are now shifting to online[cite: 83]. For instance, many restaurants now require customers to have orders by scanning QR codes with their mobile devices[cite: 84]. This can effectively reduce the need for direct interaction with staff[cite: 85]. Hence, the application of digital ordering systems will lead to a reduction of in-person service[cite: 86]. As operators try to maximize efficiency and minimize the cost, the availability of physical service options decreases[cite: 87]. This trend may cause more and more trouble for some people, particularly for individuals who may lack digital literacy or access to ICT[cite: 88]. Moreover, the increasing reliance on digital services may exacerbate the digital divide, leaving vulnerable groups, like the elderly, more difficult to access social services[cite: 89]. Besides, more cyber criminals have targeted the elderly as they are vulnerable to cybercrimes and lack ICT knowledge, so they are more likely to believe the fraud and be trapped by malwares[cite: 90].</p>

        <h3>Difficulties they faced</h3>
        <p>The digital technology has developed for many years that many applications may be perceived as very complicated by the elderly [cite: 91] because these applications are often designed in similar logic which people who is familiar with may find it easy to use. However, people who are not familiar with them may face many problems and lack skills to fix themselves[cite: 92]. Also, some digital devices may not be disability friendly. Many elderly people have physical difficulty in eyesight, hearing and hand operations etc.[cite: 93]. Many elderly people think ICT is for younger people, who are perceived as the digital native (commonly defined as the people who have lived with ICT since their birth), instead of themselves and take this for granted[cite: 94]. However, most elderly people in fact have the ability of learning new things with the correct attitude[cite: 95]. The habitual thinking that they are bad at ICT may further cause them to escape from knowing more about it no matter due to habitual sense or not confidence of learning it[cite: 96]. Taking off the label that they are ‘digital immigrants’ from others or themselves is a challenge of promoting ICT[cite: 97]. Also, cases of fraud may repel the elderly more from ICT[cite: 98]. Non confidence of the technologies that they can’t understand will make them resist knowing more about ICT[cite: 99].</p>

        <h3>Benefits of promoting ICT</h3>
        <p>However, as mentioned, our life will be more relying on ICT, and therefore it is an important life skill now[cite: 100]. By learning ICT, the elderly can have self-services like online health services[cite: 101]. Hence, this will reduce the need for assistance to them[cite: 102]. The government or the NGO may reduce the cost of employment and put the budget into other services and hence make the social resources be used more cost-efficiently[cite: 103]. Also, many elderly may not live with their younger family members and rarely gather, ICT can help them to keep their relationships by communication app, video chat etc. Of course, this can be used to chat with their friends[cite: 104]. This can absolutely ease the communication anxiety and loneliness of the elderly[cite: 105]. They can seek help from others easily by that as well[cite: 106].</p>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Elderly people are participants of our society therefore we should help them to be included in the digital world and prevent them from being marginalized[cite: 107]. First, the development of ICT should be more considerate. Both hardware and software developers should be encouraged to increase elderly-friendly features[cite: 108]. For example, including a simpler mode for mobile phone that reduces some complicated and not necessary functions[cite: 109]. Larger default buttons and fonts and more detailed instructions should be included as well[cite: 110]. Furthermore, the marginalization of elderly groups is in fact a complicated issue caused by multiple factors which include economic, social and psychological factors[cite: 111]. Thus, more cross-sector study should be made to have a clearer understanding of the issues[cite: 112]. This can help keep track of the effectiveness of the measures taken too[cite: 113]. Moreover, tutorials for elderly people are important. The problems that may occur while using digital technology can mostly find the solution on the internet or the FAQ of the using instructions[cite: 114]. Therefore, teaching one how to use ICT to learn ICT is a more effective way[cite: 115]. First, more resources for the above key concept should be provided[cite: 116]. Also, more professional training among the volunteers and tutors should be offered[cite: 117]. As mentioned, digital divide is quite sophisticated so the volunteers should all have better recognition of the problems that the elderly may have so that they can solve them more properly[cite: 118]. Besides, assistance from family members usually plays a more important role[cite: 119]. The awareness of caring for older family members should be raised[cite: 120]. Relatives of the elderly can help with the daily ICT usage of them[cite: 121]. Some ICT tutorial workshops may encourage younger family members to participate with the elderly in order to offer a chance for them to practice guiding the elderly[cite: 122].</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The elderly have various problems while using ICT which leads to a digital divide[cite: 123]. As ICT is already part of our daily life and we are going to rely on it more in the future, it is crucial to help the elderly not to be marginalized[cite: 124]. Also, there are many benefits for both the elderly and the entire society, so promotion of ICT among the elderly is important[cite: 125]. Younger people should also pay more attention to the difficulties the elderly have[cite: 126].</p>
